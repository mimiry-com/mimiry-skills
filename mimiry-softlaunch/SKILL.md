  Early-access skill for Mimiry's softlaunch GPU compute platform. Use this
  skill whenever the user wants to run a GPU job, start a compute session, train
  a model, launch a container on a GPU, check their balance, manage running
  sessions, or build a compute job script on the Mimiry softlaunch environment.
  Also triggers when the user mentions Mimiry softlaunch, Mimiry compute, GPU
  sessions, SSH-ing into a session, or asks to "run this on a GPU" or "launch a
  training job". Covers both quick one-liners and interactive job-building
  workflows. This is the softlaunch (early beta) version — the API and features
  may change.

## Locating Skill Scripts

This skill bundles helper scripts in its `scripts/` subdirectory. Before
running any commands, locate the skill installation directory by checking
these paths (in order):

1. `~/.agents/skills/mimiry-softlaunch/` (npx skills standard location)
2. `~/.claude/skills/mimiry-softlaunch/` (Claude Code symlink)

Use whichever exists. In all command examples below, **`SKILL_DIR`** is a
placeholder for this resolved path — substitute the actual path when
executing commands.

---

This skill covers two concerns:

1. **API operations** (always available) — auth, list sessions, get status,
   logs, terminate, check balance/quota
2. **Job building** (when creating something new) — choose an image strategy,
   pick an implementation language, generate the job script, and launch it

---

## Prerequisites

Before any API operation, verify the user has a registered SSH key. Ask:

> Do you have an SSH key registered on your Mimiry account?

**If yes** — ask for the path to the key (there is no default). The auth
script accepts either the private key path or the `.pub` path — it
normalizes automatically.

**If no** — walk them through setup:

1. **Generate a key** (if they don't have one):
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/mimiry -C "mimiry-softlaunch"
   ```
2. **Register it on Mimiry** — the user must add the public key
   (`~/.ssh/mimiry.pub`) through the Mimiry portal. There is currently no
   API for key registration. Direct them to:
   `https://softlaunch.mimiry.com` → Profile → SSH Keys → Add Key
3. Once the key is registered, proceed with the key path they chose.

The same SSH key serves two purposes: authenticating with the API (signature
exchange) and SSH access into running sessions.

**Other requirements:** `curl`, `jq`, `ssh-keygen`, and `openssl` must be
available on the user's system.

---

## Part 1: API Operations (Always Available)

These are the building blocks used by everything else.

### Authentication

The auth algorithm uses SSH signature exchange (not a simple API key). **Always
use the bundled auth script** — do not re-implement the signing logic inline.
The algorithm has several non-obvious details (message format, namespace,
file-based signing) that are easy to get wrong.

```bash
source SKILL_DIR/scripts/mimiry-auth.sh <ssh_key_path>
# Exports: MIMIRY_TOKEN, MIMIRY_API
```

Tokens expire after 1 hour — re-authenticate if you get 401s.

**API base:** `https://softlaunch.mimiry.com`
**Compute prefix:** `/api/compute/v1`

> **CRITICAL — All commands MUST be wrapped in `bash -c`.**
> The Bash tool loads the user's shell profile, which can interfere with
> command execution. Always wrap the entire command in `bash -c '...'` to
> run in a clean, non-interactive shell.
>
> Shell state does not persist between Bash tool calls. Each call spawns a
> **new shell**. You MUST include `source` in every `bash -c` invocation.
> Never run `source` in one Bash call and use `$MIMIRY_API` / `$MIMIRY_TOKEN`
> in a separate one.

### Common Operations

> **These commands are for the agent's own shell.** Always include the
> `source` line. **Never copy these verbatim into user-facing output** —
> the variables won't exist in the user's terminal. When printing
> commands for the user, follow the "After Session Creation" section.

Every API call must be wrapped in `bash -c` with `source` included.

**Check GPU availability** (public — no auth required):
```bash
bash -c 'curl -s "https://softlaunch.mimiry.com/api/compute/v1/availability" | jq .'
```
Returns all available GPU models with per-provider pricing and locations.
Each model includes a `providers` array showing which providers offer it
and at what locations (e.g. `"verda"` at `"FIN-01"`). Use this as a
pre-flight check before creating sessions, and to discover valid
`provider` and `location` values for session creation hints.

Optional query params: `provider=verda`, `gpu_family=H100,T4`,
`min_vram_gb=40`, `location=FIN-01`, `available_only=false`, `detail=full`.

**Response structure** (abbreviated):
```json
{
  "gpu_models": [
    {
      "name": "T4",
      "family": "T4",
      "vram_gb": 16,
      "available": true,
      "currency": "EUR",
      "providers": [
        { "provider": "verda", "hourly_rate": 0.32, "locations": ["FIN-01"] }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "H100_SXM",
      "family": "H100",
      "vram_gb": 80,
      "available": true,
      "currency": "EUR",
      "providers": [
        { "provider": "verda", "hourly_rate": 2.10, "locations": ["FIN-01"] },
        { "provider": "acme", "hourly_rate": 2.50, "locations": ["US-EAST-1"] }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Finding the cheapest GPU from a specific provider:** Filter `gpu_models`
to entries where the `providers` array contains the target provider, then
sort by that provider's `hourly_rate`. Example using jq:
```bash
bash -c 'curl -s "https://softlaunch.mimiry.com/api/compute/v1/availability" | jq --arg p "verda" '"'"'[.gpu_models[] | select(.available) | {name, hourly_rate: ([.providers[] | select(.provider == $p) | .hourly_rate] | first)} | select(.hourly_rate)] | sort_by(.hourly_rate) | first'"'"''
```
This returns the cheapest available GPU offered by the given provider
(name + rate). Use that `name` as `gpu.types[0]` and the provider as
`gpu.provider` when creating the session.

**Check balance** (do this before creating sessions):
```bash
bash -c 'source SKILL_DIR/scripts/mimiry-auth.sh <ssh_key_path> && curl -s "${MIMIRY_API}/balance" -H "Authorization: Bearer $MIMIRY_TOKEN" | jq .'
```

**List sessions:**
```bash
bash -c 'source SKILL_DIR/scripts/mimiry-auth.sh <ssh_key_path> && curl -s "${MIMIRY_API}/sessions" -H "Authorization: Bearer $MIMIRY_TOKEN" | jq .'
```

**Get session details:**
```bash
bash -c 'source SKILL_DIR/scripts/mimiry-auth.sh <ssh_key_path> && curl -s "${MIMIRY_API}/sessions/$SESSION_ID" -H "Authorization: Bearer $MIMIRY_TOKEN" | jq .'
```

**Get logs** (session must be `running`):
```bash
bash -c 'source SKILL_DIR/scripts/mimiry-auth.sh <ssh_key_path> && curl -s "${MIMIRY_API}/sessions/$SESSION_ID/logs?tail=50" -H "Authorization: Bearer $MIMIRY_TOKEN" | jq -r .logs'
```
- HTTP 503 → VM still setting up, retry after `retry_after_seconds`
- HTTP 409 → session not running, check status first

**Terminate session:**
```bash
bash -c 'source SKILL_DIR/scripts/mimiry-auth.sh <ssh_key_path> && curl -s -X DELETE "${MIMIRY_API}/sessions/$SESSION_ID" -H "Authorization: Bearer $MIMIRY_TOKEN" | jq .'
```

**Check quota:**
```bash
bash -c 'source SKILL_DIR/scripts/mimiry-auth.sh <ssh_key_path> && curl -s "${MIMIRY_API}/quota" -H "Authorization: Bearer $MIMIRY_TOKEN" | jq .'
```

**Transaction history:**
```bash
bash -c 'source SKILL_DIR/scripts/mimiry-auth.sh <ssh_key_path> && curl -s "${MIMIRY_API}/transactions" -H "Authorization: Bearer $MIMIRY_TOKEN" | jq .'
```

## Part 2: Job Building (When Creating Something New)

When the user wants to create a new compute job, gather the required
information through natural conversation. **Do not use `AskUserQuestion`
with fixed option lists** — instead, ask plain questions and let the user
respond in their own words. This produces a better experience because
users often provide multiple answers at once, clarify context, or ask
follow-up questions that rigid option menus can't accommodate.

### What to gather

Work through these in conversation, adapting to what the user has already
told you (they may have answered several in their initial request):

1. **SSH key path** — needed for auth and session SSH access
2. **Image** — what container to run. Suggest common options if they're
   unsure:
   - PyTorch: `nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:24.01-py3`
   - TensorFlow: `nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorflow:24.01-tf2-py3`
   - Plain CUDA: `nvcr.io/nvidia/cuda:12.3.1-devel-ubuntu22.04`
   - Or any public image URI / custom Dockerfile
3. **GPU type** — check the `/availability` endpoint to see what's currently
   available. Multiple providers may offer different GPU models at different
   locations. Default to the cheapest available option unless the user needs
   more power. Common types include `T4`, `V100`, `A100`, `H100_SXM` — but
   always verify via `/availability` rather than hardcoding
4. **Provider/location preference** (optional) — if the user has a preference
   for a specific provider (e.g. `verda`) or location (e.g. `FIN-01`), these
   can be passed as hints in `gpu.provider` and `gpu.location`. They are not
   guaranteed — the system falls back to best available if the preference
   can't be satisfied. Show available providers/locations from `/availability`
   if the user asks
5. **What to run** — a command/script, or interactive SSH access?
6. **Session name** — suggest a sensible default based on the image/task

Optional (only ask if relevant to what the user described):
- Environment variables
- Auto-terminate behavior (default: `true` if command, `false` if interactive)

Once you have enough information, authenticate, create the session, poll
until running, and print management commands per "After Session Creation".

---

## Creating the Session

> **Agent-internal code** — do not print this block to the user.
> All commands MUST be wrapped in `bash -c '...'`.

Regardless of how decisions were made, the session creation call looks like:

```bash
bash -c 'source SKILL_DIR/scripts/mimiry-auth.sh <ssh_key_path> && PUB_KEY=$(cat "<ssh_key_path>.pub") && curl -s -X POST "${MIMIRY_API}/sessions" -H "Authorization: Bearer $MIMIRY_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '"'"'{"name": "<session_name>", "image": {"uri": "<image_uri>"}, "gpu": {"types": ["<gpu_type>"], "count": 1}, "ssh_enabled": true, "ssh_public_key": "'"'"'"'"'"'"'"'"'$PUB_KEY'"'"'"'"'"'"'"'"'", "command": "<command_or_null>", "auto_terminate": <true|false>}'"'"' | jq .'
```

**Tip:** The JSON body quoting is complex. A cleaner approach is to build
the JSON with jq:

```bash
bash -c 'source SKILL_DIR/scripts/mimiry-auth.sh <ssh_key_path> && PUB_KEY=$(cat "<ssh_key_path>.pub") && JSON=$(jq -n --arg name "<session_name>" --arg image "<image_uri>" --arg gpu "<gpu_type>" --arg key "$PUB_KEY" --arg cmd "<command>" '"'"'{name: $name, image: {uri: $image}, gpu: {types: [$gpu], count: 1}, ssh_enabled: true, ssh_public_key: $key, command: $cmd, auto_terminate: false}'"'"') && curl -s -X POST "${MIMIRY_API}/sessions" -H "Authorization: Bearer $MIMIRY_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "$JSON" | jq .'
```

To include provider/location preferences, add them to the `gpu` object:
```bash
# ... same as above but with provider/location hints in the jq call:
JSON=$(jq -n --arg name "..." --arg image "..." --arg gpu "T4" --arg key "$PUB_KEY" --arg provider "verda" --arg location "FIN-01" \
  '{name: $name, image: {uri: $image}, gpu: {types: [$gpu], count: 1, provider: $provider, location: $location}, ssh_enabled: true, ssh_public_key: $key, auto_terminate: false}')
```
Only include `provider` and `location` when the user explicitly requests
them — they are optional hints.

**Field guide:**

| Field | When | Value |
|-------|------|-------|
| `command` | User has a script to run | The command string |
| `command` | Interactive access | Omit entirely |
| `auto_terminate` | Has a command | `true` or `{"mode":"on_complete"}` |
| `auto_terminate` | Interactive / long-running | `false` or `{"mode":"never"}` |
| `auto_terminate` | Only terminate on success | `{"mode":"on_success"}` |
| `ssh_public_key` | Always required | Contents of `<key>.pub` |
| `gpu.types` | User doesn't specify | Use cheapest available from `/availability` |
| `gpu.provider` | User prefers a provider | Provider name string (e.g. `"verda"`). Optional hint |
| `gpu.location` | User prefers a location | Location string (e.g. `"FIN-01"`). Optional hint |
| `environment_vars` | User needs env config | `{"KEY": "value", ...}` |

## Session Lifecycle

Two dimensions:
- **`state`** (durable milestone): `submitted → provisioned → started → completed/failed/stopped → terminated`
- **`status`** (transient): `provisioning`, `setting_up`, `pulling_image`, `starting_container`, `running`, `stopping_container`, `terminating`

```
POST /sessions → state:submitted → state:provisioned                                                              → state:started → state:completed
                 status:provisioning  status:setting_up  status:pulling_image  status:starting_container  status:running      ↓
                                                                                                                         state:terminated
                                              DELETE /sessions/{id}
                                                     ↓
                                              state:stopped → state:terminated

On error at any stage → state:failed or state:provision_failed
```

Poll every 5 seconds until `started` (agent-internal, not user-facing).
The entire loop MUST be in a single `bash -c` call:
```bash
bash -c 'source SKILL_DIR/scripts/mimiry-auth.sh <ssh_key_path> && while true; do RESP=$(curl -s "${MIMIRY_API}/sessions/$SESSION_ID" -H "Authorization: Bearer $MIMIRY_TOKEN"); STATE=$(echo "$RESP" | jq -r .state); STATUS=$(echo "$RESP" | jq -r .status); echo "State: $STATE | Status: $STATUS"; case "$STATE" in started) break ;; failed|provision_failed) echo "FAILED: $(echo $RESP | jq -r .error)"; break ;; completed|terminated|stopped) echo "Session ended unexpectedly"; break ;; esac; sleep 5; done'
```

Once running, extract SSH details from `$RESP` (still in the same shell)
and then print **user-facing management commands** per the "After Session
Creation" section below. Include the SSH command with resolved values:
```bash
# Extract from $RESP (in the same bash -c call as the polling loop above):
SSH_HOST=$(echo "$RESP" | jq -r '.ssh.host')

# Then print for the user (with actual values substituted):
# ssh -i <key_path> -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o LogLevel=ERROR <host>
# Plus the mirc helper commands — see "After Session Creation"
```

> **Note:** SSH sessions connect through the ssh-proxy on port 22 (the
> default SSH port), which lands users directly inside their container.
> No special port or username is needed — just `ssh -i <key> <host>`.

---

## After Session Creation

Once a session is running, print management commands the user can copy-paste
into their terminal. There is a **critical rule**: never print commands that
contain unresolved shell variables like `${MIMIRY_API}` or `$MIMIRY_TOKEN` —
those only exist inside the agent's shell, not in the user's terminal. Either
use the `mirc` helper (which handles auth internally) or print fully
resolved URLs with the auth source command included.

### Default: Quick Commands (mirc helper)

Print these by default. Replace `<session_id>` and `<key_path>` with the
actual values from the session that was just created:

```
# Manage your session (run in any terminal):
mirc status <session_id> --key <key_path>
mirc logs <session_id>
mirc ssh <session_id>
mirc terminate <session_id>
```

The `--key` flag is only needed on the first command — the path is cached
for subsequent calls. If the user has already run a `mirc` command in this
terminal session, `--key` can be omitted entirely.

The helper script lives at:
`SKILL_DIR/scripts/mirc.sh`

If the user hasn't added it to their PATH, print the full path on first use.
For convenience, suggest:
```bash
alias mirc='SKILL_DIR/scripts/mirc.sh'
```

### Alternative: Create via mirc CLI

Sessions can also be created directly from the command line using `mirc create`:
```bash
mirc create --name training --image nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:24.01-py3 --gpu T4 --key ~/.ssh/mimiry
mirc create --name job1 --image myimage:latest --gpu A100 --command "python train.py" --provider verda
```

This is the CLI equivalent of the agent's `POST /sessions` curl approach.
Use `mirc create --help` for all available flags.

### Alternative: Raw API Commands

Print these when the user asks about automation, pipelines, CI/CD, or wants
to understand what's happening under the hood. Always include the auth source
command so the variables are defined:

```bash
# Authenticate (sets $MIMIRY_TOKEN for 1 hour, re-run to refresh):
source SKILL_DIR/scripts/mimiry-auth.sh <key_path>

# Check status:
curl -s "https://softlaunch.mimiry.com/api/compute/v1/sessions/<session_id>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MIMIRY_TOKEN" | jq .

# Get logs:
curl -s "https://softlaunch.mimiry.com/api/compute/v1/sessions/<session_id>/logs?tail=50" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MIMIRY_TOKEN" | jq -r '.logs'

# Terminate:
curl -s -X DELETE "https://softlaunch.mimiry.com/api/compute/v1/sessions/<session_id>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MIMIRY_TOKEN" | jq .
```

Note: in raw commands, always use the fully resolved URL
(`https://softlaunch.mimiry.com/api/compute/v1/...`), never `${MIMIRY_API}`.
The only variable that's acceptable is `$MIMIRY_TOKEN` because the `source`
command on the line above defines it.

### Token Expiry Guidance

Tokens last 1 hour. When printing post-session commands, mention:
- The `mirc` helper auto-refreshes tokens (no action needed)
- For raw API commands, re-run the `source` command to get a fresh token
- If a command returns HTTP 401, the token has expired

## Error Reference

| Error | Meaning | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| `Invalid SSH signature` | Auth algorithm wrong | Ensure the bundled auth script is being used |
| `Timestamp expired` | Clock drift > 5 min | Sync system clock |
| `SSH key not registered` | Key not on account | Register key in Mimiry portal |
| `insufficient_balance` | No credits | Ask admin to add credits |
| `no_balance` | No billing account | Ask admin to create one |
| `vm_setup_in_progress` (503) | VM booting | Retry after `retry_after_seconds` |
| `invalid_state` (409) | Wrong session state for operation | Check session status |

## Tips

- **ALWAYS wrap commands in `bash -c '...'`** — the Bash tool's default
  shell loads user profile scripts that can interfere with command execution.
  `bash -c` runs in a clean non-interactive shell, avoiding these issues.
- The same SSH key authenticates with the API and provides session SSH access
- Billing runs from provisioning to termination — remind users to terminate
  idle sessions
- Available GPUs vary by provider — always check `/availability` before
  suggesting GPU types. Multiple providers may offer different models at
  different locations and prices. When the user doesn't specify, default
  to the cheapest available option
- When generating scripts for the user, include error handling for common
  failure modes (402 insufficient balance, 429 quota exceeded)
- **Exploration vs. automation**: Default to `mirc` helper commands for
  interactive use. Switch to raw curl commands when the user mentions
  pipelines, CI/CD, scripting, or automation — and always include the full
  auth `source` command so the commands are self-contained
- **Never print unresolved variables** in user-facing commands. `${MIMIRY_API}`
  and `$MIMIRY_TOKEN` only exist inside the agent's shell session. See the
  "After Session Creation" section for the correct patterns
